What’s in my fridge?

July 18, 2022

App Overview
		Everyone who cooks looks inside their fridge to find out what they can cook with the available ingredients in their fridge. “What’s in my Fridge?”  App will do just that. When a user enters the ingredients that they have on hand, the app will find out recipes that they can click and access. It will focus on recipes which  mainly use the user’s ingredients. It will have a home page, about page, page to search for recipes and an error page.As stretch goals, I hope to add random food jokes/gifs to it too.

MVP
		The App has the following pages:
Home - Search Bar
About - Description of the App and instructions on how to use
My Fridge - Search for Recipes, display recipe thumbnails
Recipe - Will showcase the recipe the user clicked
Error(Incase of page not found)

Post-MVP
	Post MVP, additional widgets which give nutritional information on the food and display random food trivia can be added to it.

SWOT ANALYSIS
STRENGTHS - Idea, Design
WEAKNESS - Props,API Endpoints,Logic
OPPORTUNITIES - Widgets to show how a food might taste, meal plan, grocery list generator
THREATS - Using multiple API’s? Efficiently using API to produce end result
	At this point of the project, I have to ensure the API endpoints are efficiently utilized for the App.
